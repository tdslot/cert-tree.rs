# Product Description: cert-tree.rs

## Why This Project Exists

In the world of cybersecurity and software development, X.509 certificates are fundamental to secure communications, but their complexity often makes them difficult to inspect and understand. Security professionals, developers, and system administrators frequently need to:

- **Verify certificate validity** and expiration dates with color-coded status
- **Inspect certificate chains** and trust relationships with hierarchical tree display
- **Analyze public key information** and algorithms with key size details
- **Check certificate extensions** for security constraints
- **Debug SSL/TLS issues** in production environments
- **Interactive TUI** for detailed certificate exploration

Existing tools like OpenSSL are powerful but often produce verbose, hard-to-read output that requires deep knowledge of certificate internals. Web-based certificate inspectors exist but don't work offline and can't handle local files easily.

## The Problem We Solve

**Current Challenges:**
- OpenSSL output is cryptic and overwhelming for non-experts
- No unified tool for multiple input sources (files, URLs, data)
- Limited human-readable formatting options
- No easy way to export certificate data for further processing
- Certificate inspection often requires multiple tools

**Our Solution:**
cert-tree.rs provides a single, efficient command-line utility that makes certificate inspection accessible to everyone while maintaining the technical depth needed by experts. It features multiple output formats including an interactive TUI with color-coded validity status and support for certificate chain visualization.

## User Experience Goals

### For Security Professionals
- **Quick verification** of certificate validity and trust chains
- **Detailed inspection** of all certificate components
- **Multiple output formats** for different use cases (tree, JSON, verbose, TUI)
- **Certificate chain visualization** with hierarchical tree display
- **Color-coded validity status** for immediate visual feedback
- **Batch processing** capabilities for large certificate sets

### For Developers
- **Easy integration** into development workflows
- **Programmatic access** via JSON output
- **Clear error messages** for debugging SSL/TLS issues
- **Fast execution** for CI/CD pipeline integration

### For System Administrators
- **Offline operation** without internet dependency
- **Multiple input methods** (files, URLs, piped data)
- **Consistent formatting** across different certificate types
- **Reliable parsing** of various certificate formats

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Used by security teams and developers worldwide
- **Performance**: Sub-second parsing for typical certificates
- **Reliability**: Handles all common certificate formats without crashes
- **Usability**: New users can inspect certificates without reading documentation
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented Rust codebase for long-term support

## Market Position

cert-tree.rs positions itself as the go-to certificate inspection tool that bridges the gap between:
- **Power users** who need OpenSSL's depth
- **Regular users** who need simplicity and clarity
- **Automation** that needs structured data (JSON)

This creates a unique value proposition in the certificate inspection space.
