# Release Process for cert-tree.rs

This document outlines the complete process for creating a new release of cert-tree.rs, from version planning to automated GitHub release creation. The process follows semantic versioning rules and ensures consistent, high-quality releases.

## Overview

The release process is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub automation:

1. **Manual pre-release preparation** (version update, changelog, testing)
2. **Automated release creation** (git tagging triggers GitHub Actions)
3. **Fully automated distribution** (cross-platform builds and GitHub release)
4. **Post-release verification** (documentation updates and monitoring)

**Key Integration Point**: Pushing a version tag to GitHub automatically triggers the complete build and release process via GitHub Actions, eliminating manual distribution steps.

## Pre-Release Preparation

### 1. Determine Version Increment

Follow [semver rules](../rules/semver.md) to determine the appropriate version increment:

- **MAJOR** (X.y.z): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (x.Y.z): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### 2. Update Version in Code

Update the version in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "cert-tree"
version = "0.15.0"  # Update this according to semver rules
```

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add a new section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version:

```markdown
## [0.15.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- New feature description

### Changed
- Breaking change description (if applicable)

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

### Security
- Security fix description (if applicable)
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use present tense for changes ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Group changes by type: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security
- Reference issue/PR numbers when applicable
- Keep descriptions concise but informative

### 4. Run Quality Checks

Execute comprehensive quality checks before release:

```bash
just quality-release  # Full quality check (fmt + clippy + test + build)
just run-test-cert-release  # Test release binary with sample certificates
just version  # Verify version is correctly updated
```

### 5. Update Memory Bank

Update `context.md` in the memory bank with the new version and completed changes:

```markdown
## Recent Changes
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: [Description of changes]
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Updated version to 0.15.0 according to semver methodology
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: CHANGELOG.md updated with release notes for v0.15.0
```

### 6. Commit Version Changes

Create a commit for the version update:

```bash
just commit "chore(release): bump version to 0.15.0"
```

## Release Creation

### 1. Create Git Tag

Create an annotated git tag for the release:

```bash
just tag v0.15.0 "Release v0.15.0"
```

This creates a tag in the format `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.

### 2. Push Tag to GitHub

Push the tag to trigger the automated release workflow:

```bash
git push origin v0.15.0
```

**Automation Trigger**: This single command initiates the entire automated release pipeline.

## Automated GitHub Release Creation

The release process is fully automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

### Workflow Overview

The workflow triggers on tag push (`v*`) and performs:

1. **Multi-platform builds** (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. **Binary artifact creation**
3. **Release notes extraction**
4. **GitHub release creation**

### Build Matrix

The workflow builds for three platforms:
- **Linux x86_64**: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- **macOS x86_64**: `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- **Windows x86_64**: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Build Steps

For each platform:
1. **Checkout code** using `actions/checkout@v4`
2. **Install Rust** with target support using `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`
3. **Build release** with `cargo build --release --target {target}`
4. **Rename binary** to include platform identifier
5. **Upload artifact** for collection

### Release Creation

After all builds complete:
1. **Download artifacts** from all build jobs
2. **Extract version** from git tag
3. **Generate human-readable release notes** from CHANGELOG.md with enhanced formatting
4. **Create GitHub release** using `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`

#### Enhanced Release Notes Generation

The workflow automatically generates beautiful, user-friendly release notes that include:

- **üéØ Clear version information** with release highlights
- **üì¶ Download links** for all platforms with clear categorization
- **üöÄ Installation instructions** for different package managers
- **üìã What's new** section with user-friendly descriptions
- **üêõ Technical changelog** appended for developers
- **üìö Documentation and community links**

The release notes are generated using a shell script that:
1. Extracts the current version from the git tag
2. Gets the release date
3. Creates a structured, emoji-enhanced release notes document
4. Appends the raw changelog for technical details

**Key Features:**
- **Platform-specific download sections** (Linux, macOS)
- **Package manager instructions** (DEB, RPM, tar.gz)
- **Quick start examples** for immediate use
- **Community links** for support and contributions
- **Professional formatting** with consistent styling

**Example generated release notes:**

```markdown
